	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p> I am a doctoral student of mathematics education at the University of Michigan. Came to this work after earning a Master’s degree in mathematics and several years of experience teaching high school mathematics in Washington, DC. Currently interested in how students’ gendered and racialized performances influence the type of recognition they receive as math-doers from their peers and teachers and how this interacts with their math identity development.
